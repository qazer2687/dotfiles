* ToDo
This file is just for me to track things I'm working on with my dotfiles and also try out org-mode.

** Key
✅: done

❎: scrapped

else: todo 

* Hosts

** Jade
Needs a complete overhaul tbh. It's been using i3 since I switched to linux so I might try something else like xmonad or dwm.

*** Tasks

** Ruby

*** Tasks
- switch back to sway from gnome when i eventually get it back

** Onyx
How the Onyx configuration should eventually work:
I will use homebrew to install all my graphical applications and then use home-manager move per-app configs to where they should be.
Any commandline programs should be installed with nix and then with homebrew as a fallback.
The reason I use homebrew for graphical applications is that they are indexed by spotlight search.

*** Tasks
- get apps installed by nix to be indexed in spotlight search
- get rid of the shared folder


** Opal

*** Tasks
- buy some more ram
